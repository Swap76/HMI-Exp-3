					<h3><a href="http://sand.truman.edu/~ns7442/project/mandala.html"> Mandala</a></h3>
					<p>The meaning of mandala comes from Sanskrit meaning "circle." Even though it may be dominated by squares or triangles, a mandala has a concentric structure. Mandalas offer balancing visual elements, symbolizing unity and harmony. The goal of the mandala is to serve as a tool on our spiritual journey as it symbolizes cosmic and psychic order.</p>
